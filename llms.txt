- Dual interface: GUI (OTFeatureFreezer) and CLI (pyftfeatfreeze)
- Cross-platform support (macOS and Windows)
- Recently modernized build system (Hatch)
- Type annotations added with Mypy checking
- Comprehensive linting with Ruff

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Documentation**: Limited inline documentation and API references
2. **Testing**: Test coverage could be expanded
3. **Error Handling**: Some areas use generic exceptions
4. **Packaging**: Complex dual packaging (PyInstaller for GUI, Hatch for CLI)
5. **CI/CD**: No visible automated testing or deployment pipeline
6. **Code Organization**: Some long functions that could be refactored
7. **User Experience**: GUI could benefit from modern UI improvements

## Detailed Improvement Plan

# OpenType Feature Freezer: Make Advanced Typography Accessible Everywhere

**OpenType Feature Freezer** is a powerful tool designed to make sophisticated typographic features, like small caps or old-style numerals, accessible by default in your fonts. This means you can use these features even in applications with limited or no OpenType support.

## Part 1: For Everyone Using Fonts

### What Does It Do?

Many professional fonts come with "OpenType features" – special typographic effects such as true small capitals, alternative character shapes, ligatures, or figures (numbers) that align differently with text. Normally, you need specific software that allows you to turn these features on.

OpenType Feature Freezer modifies a font file so that selected OpenType features are "frozen" into it. The characters that were previously only accessible via these features become the default characters in the modified font.

For example, if you freeze the "small caps" (`smcp`) feature, typing lowercase letters will directly produce small capitals.

### Who Is It For?

This tool is for anyone who wants to use advanced typographic features in applications that don't provide easy access to OpenType controls. This includes:

*   Users of office suites like LibreOffice or OpenOffice.
*   Graphic designers working with software that might not support specific OpenType features (e.g., some versions of Microsoft Office have limited small caps support).
*   Anyone who wants a font variant where certain features are always active without manual intervention.

### Why Is It Useful?

*   **Accessibility:** Unlocks advanced typography in a wider range of applications.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that specific typographic styles (like old-style figures) are used consistently without needing to remember to enable features.
*   **Convenience:** Creates ready-to-use font versions with desired features baked in.

### Installation

OpenType Feature Freezer is available in two forms:

*   **OTFeatureFreezer (GUI):** A graphical application for macOS and Windows.
*   **pyftfeatfreeze (CLI):** A command-line tool for users comfortable with terminal commands.

#### OTFeatureFreezer GUI App (macOS)

1.  **[Download the DMG for macOS](https://github.com/twardoch/fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer/raw/master/download/OTFeatureFreezer.dmg)**
2.  Open the downloaded DMG file.
3.  Drag the `OTFeatureFreezer.app` icon to your `/Applications` folder.
4.  **First Run:** Ctrl+click the `OTFeatureFreezer.app` icon in `/Applications`, choose "Open" from the menu, and then click "Open" in the dialog box.
5.  Subsequent Runs: Double-click the app icon.

#### OTFeatureFreezer GUI App (Windows 64-bit)

1.  **[Download the ZIP for Windows](https://github.com/twardoch/fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer/raw/master/download/OTFeatureFreezer.zip)**
2.  You need a 64-bit version of Windows (7 or newer).
3.  Unzip the downloaded file.
4.  Run `setup_featfreeze.exe` to install the application.
5.  Launch "OTFeatureFreezer" from your Start Menu.

#### pyftfeatfreeze CLI App (All Platforms)

This requires Python 3.6 or newer. If you don't have Python, get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or your system's package manager.

**Recommended Method (using pipx):**
Pipx installs Python command-line tools in isolated environments, which is clean and convenient.
```bash
pipx install opentype-feature-freezer
```
To upgrade later:
```bash
pipx upgrade opentype-feature-freezer
```

**Alternative Method (using pip):**
It's generally recommended to run `pip` via `python3 -m pip` to ensure you're using `pip` associated with the correct Python installation, especially if you have multiple Python versions.
It's best to do this inside a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade opentype-feature-freezer
```
If the above fails, or for a user-specific installation (avoids needing admin rights):
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade opentype-feature-freezer
```

**Development Version (from GitHub - for testing latest changes):**
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/twardoch/fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer
```

### How to Use

#### Using the OTFeatureFreezer GUI

The GUI provides an easy-to-use interface for all the freezing and renaming options:

1.  **Input Font File:** Click to browse and select your input `.otf` or `.ttf` font file.
2.  **Output Font File:** Specify where to save the modified font (`[input_filename].featfreeze.otf` by default).
3.  **Options to control feature freezing:**
    *   **Features:** Enter a comma-separated list of OpenType feature tags (e.g., `smcp,c2sc,onum`). These are the features you want to "freeze."
    *   **Script:** Optionally, specify an OpenType script tag (e.g., `cyrl`, `latn`) to apply features only for that script. If blank, features are applied across all relevant scripts.
    *   **Lang:** Optionally, specify an OpenType language tag (e.g., `SRB ` for Serbian) to apply features for that specific language system.
    *   **Zap glyphnames...:** (Advanced, TTF only) Removes glyph names from the font, potentially reducing file size.
4.  **Options to control font renaming:**
    *   **Add a suffix to the font family name:** If checked, a suffix is added. By default, this suffix is constructed from the frozen feature tags (e.g., "MyFont SMCP C2SC").
    *   **Use a custom suffix...:** If the above is checked, you can specify your own suffix here (e.g., "SC").
    *   **Search for strings...:** Allows renaming parts of the font's internal names. Format: `search1/replace1,search2/replace2`.
    *   **Update font version string:** Adds information about the frozen features to the font's version string.
5.  **Reporting options:**
    *   **Report languages, scripts and features...:** Instead of modifying the font, this option prints out information about the features, scripts, and languages present in the input font.
    *   **Output names of remapped glyphs...:** Prints the names of glyphs that were changed during the freezing process.
    *   **Print additional information...:** Verbose mode, shows more details during processing.
6.  Click "Run" (or the equivalent button, often the program name itself at the bottom of the Gooey interface) to process the font.

The GUI includes a "Help" menu with links to "About" information and the project's online documentation.

#### Using the pyftfeatfreeze CLI

The basic command structure is:
```bash
pyftfeatfreeze [OPTIONS] INPATH [OUTPATH]
```

*   `INPATH`: Path to the input `.otf` or `.ttf` font file.
*   `OUTPATH`: Optional path for the output font file. If omitted, it defaults to `INPATH.featfreeze.otf`.

**Common CLI Options:**

*   `-f TAGS, --features TAGS`: Comma-separated OpenType feature tags (e.g., `'smcp,c2sc'`).
*   `-s SCRIPT, --script SCRIPT`: OpenType script tag (e.g., `cyrl`). If omitted, processing applies to all relevant scripts.
*   `-l LANG, --lang LANG`: OpenType language tag (e.g., `SRB `).
*   `-S, --suffix`: Add a suffix to font family name (derived from feature tags).
*   `-U SUFFIX, --usesuffix SUFFIX`: Use a custom suffix (e.g., `SC`) when `-S` is active.
*   `-R 'S/R,...', --replacenames 'S/R,...'`: Search and replace strings in font names (e.g., `'MyFont/MyFontNew,Regular/Reg'`).
*   `-z, --zapnames`: Zap glyph names from TTF fonts.
*   `-i, --info`: Update font version string.
*   `-r, --report`: Report font's features, scripts, languages instead of processing.
*   `-n, --names`: Output names of remapped glyphs.
*   `-v, --verbose`: Print detailed processing information.
*   `-V, --version`: Show program version.
*   `-h, --help`: Show help message with all options.

**CLI Examples:**

1.  **Freeze small caps and old-style numerals, add "SC OS" suffix, rename "OpenSans" to "OpenSansSC":**
    ```bash
    pyftfeatfreeze -f 'c2sc,smcp,onum' -S -U "SC OS" -R 'OpenSans/OpenSansSO' OpenSans-Regular.ttf OpenSansSO-Regular.ttf
    ```

2.  **Freeze Bulgarian localized forms (`locl` for Cyrillic script, Bulgarian language), add "BG" suffix:**
    ```bash
    pyftfeatfreeze -f 'locl' -s 'cyrl' -l 'BGR ' -S -U BG MyFont.otf MyFontBG.otf
    ```
    *Note: To remap features for multiple script/language combinations, run the tool multiple times, using the output of one run as the input for the next. Apply renaming options (`-S`, `-U`, `-R`) typically on the final run.*

3.  **Only rename parts of the font's internal name (no feature freezing):**
    ```bash
    pyftfeatfreeze -R 'Lato/Otal,Regular/Rg' Lato-Regular.ttf Otal-Rg.ttf
    ```

## Part 2: For Developers & Contributors

### How the Code Works (Internals)

The core logic resides in the `RemapByOTL` class within `src/opentype_feature_freezer/__init__.py`. The process flow is as follows:

1.  **Font Opening:** The input font file is opened using `fontTools.ttLib.TTFont`.
2.  **Feature and Lookup Filtering:**
    *   The tool identifies relevant GSUB (Glyph Substitution) lookups.
    *   It filters these lookups based on user-specified OpenType feature tags (`--features`), script tag (`--script`), and language tag (`--lang`).
    *   If no script is specified, the tool attempts to apply features across all relevant scripts by processing each script tag found. For language systems within a script, if a specific language is not given or does not match an existing `LangSysRecord`, the `DefaultLangSys` for that script is used.
3.  **Substitution Application:**
    *   It processes GSUB LookupType 1 (Single Substitution) and LookupType 3 (Alternate Substitution).
    *   It also handles LookupType 7 (Extension Substitution) which can wrap Type 1 or Type 3 lookups.
    *   A substitution mapping is built, tracking which original glyph names should be replaced by which new glyph names. For alternate substitutions, the first alternate glyph from the list is chosen (e.g., `a.alt1` from `[a.alt1, a.alt2]`).
4.  **`cmap` Remapping:**
    *   The font's character map (`cmap` table) is modified. Existing Unicode codepoints that pointed to original glyphs are updated to point to the new glyphs resulting from the applied substitutions. This is what makes the features "default."
5.  **Font Renaming (Optional):**
    *   If requested via options like `--suffix`, `--usesuffix`, or `--replacenames`, the tool modifies various name records in the `name` table (e.g., Family Name (ID 1), Full Name (ID 4), PostScript Name (ID 6), Version String (ID 5), Unique ID (ID 3), WWS Family/Subfamily (ID 16, 17)).
    *   For CFF-based OpenType fonts (`.otf`), it also updates `FamilyName`, `FullName`, and the main font name in the `CFF ` table.
6.  **Glyph Name Zapping (Optional):**
    *   For TrueType-flavored fonts (`.ttf`), the `--zapnames` option sets the `post` table format to 3.0. This removes glyph names from the font, which can sometimes reduce file size but makes debugging harder.
7.  **Font Saving:** The modified font object is saved to the output path using `fontTools.ttLib.TTFont.save()`.

**Key Modules:**

*   `src/opentype_feature_freezer/__init__.py`: Contains the `RemapByOTL` class with the primary font processing logic.
*   `src/opentype_feature_freezer/cli.py`: Implements the `pyftfeatfreeze` command-line interface using Python's `argparse` module. It parses arguments and passes them to `RemapByOTL`.
*   `app/OTFeatureFreezer.py`: Uses `ezgooey` to wrap the `argparse` definitions from `cli.py`, creating the `OTFeatureFreezer` GUI application for macOS and Windows.

**Limitations:**

*   **Supported Substitutions:** Primarily handles GSUB Single (Type 1) and Alternate (Type 3) substitutions, including those within Extension (Type 7) lookups. It does not process other GSUB lookup types like Ligature, Multiple, or Chaining Contextual substitutions.
*   **`cmap` Dependency:** The tool works by remapping existing `cmap` entries. If a glyph involved in a substitution (either the original or the replacement) does not have a Unicode value assigned in any `cmap` table, that specific remapping might not have a visible effect through standard character input. A warning is issued in such cases.
*   **Global Feature Application:** Features are applied based on the chosen script and language for the entire font. The tool does not interpret complex conditional logic within OpenType feature definitions themselves.

### Coding Rules & Conventions

*   **Python Version:** The codebase targets Python 3.6 and newer.
*   **Type Hinting:** Modern Python type hints are used throughout the code for improved clarity, maintainability, and to facilitate static analysis. See `typing` module usage.
*   **Logging:** The standard `logging` module is used for outputting informational messages, warnings, and errors. Verbosity is controlled by the `-v` flag.
*   **Project & Dependency Management:** [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for managing dependencies, building the package, and publishing. Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Static Analysis:** [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) is used for static type checking, with configuration in `mypy.ini`.
*   **Testing:** [pytest](https://pytest.org/) is used for unit and integration testing. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory.
*   **Code Style:** While no specific linter (like Flake8 or Black) is explicitly configured in `pyproject.toml` apart from MyPy, contributions should generally follow PEP 8 guidelines and maintain consistency with the existing codebase.

# Refactoring Plan: Splitting Large Code Files

This plan outlines how to refactor the largest code files in the `fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer` project into smaller, more manageable units while maintaining existing functionality.

## 1. Refactoring `src/opentype_feature_freezer/__init__.py`

This file currently contains the monolithic `RemapByOTL` class, which handles various aspects of font processing. The goal is to break down this class into smaller, more focused modules/classes, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Current State:**
The `RemapByOTL` class is responsible for:
- Font I/O (opening, saving, closing)
- Initializing glyph substitutions
- Filtering OpenType features and lookups
- Applying glyph substitutions
- Remapping CMAP tables
- Renaming font metadata
- Reporting font information

**Proposed Structure:**

```
src/opentype_feature_freezer/
├── __init__.py             # Orchestrates the new modules/classes
├── font_io.py              # Handles font opening, saving, and closing
├── feature_processing.py   # Handles feature/lookup filtering and substitution application
├── cmap_remapping.py       # Handles CMAP table remapping
├── font_naming.py          # Handles font renaming logic
├── reporting.py            # Handles font information reporting
└── exceptions.py           # Custom exceptions (as per PLAN.md)
```

**Detailed Plan:**

1.  **Create `src/opentype_feature_freezer/font_io.py`:**
    *   Move `_openFontTTX`, `openFont`, `_saveFontTTX`, `saveFont`, `_closeFontTTX`, `closeFont` methods into a new class, e.g., `FontIOHandler`.
    *   The `FontIOHandler` class will take the `ttLib.TTFont` object as an argument in its methods or be initialized with it.
    *   Update `RemapByOTL` to instantiate and use `FontIOHandler` for font I/O operations.

2.  **Create `src/opentype_feature_freezer/feature_processing.py`:**
    *   Move `initSubs`, `filterFeatureIndex`, `filterLookupList`, and `applySubstitutions` methods into a new class, e.g., `FeatureProcessor`.
    *   This class will be initialized with the `ttLib.TTFont` object and the `options` (or relevant parts of it).
    *   It will manage `subs0`, `subs1`, `FeatureIndex`, `filterByFeatures`, `filterByLangSys`, `filterByScript`, `LookupList`, and `substitution_mapping`.
    *   Update `RemapByOTL` to instantiate and use `FeatureProcessor`.

3.  **Create `src/opentype_feature_freezer/cmap_remapping.py`:**
    *   Move `remapCmaps` method into a new class, e.g., `CmapRemapper`.
    *   This class will take the `ttLib.TTFont` object and the `substitution_mapping` as arguments.
    *   Update `RemapByOTL` to instantiate and use `CmapRemapper`.

4.  **Create `src/opentype_feature_freezer/font_naming.py`:**
    *   Move `renameFont` method into a new class, e.g., `FontNamer`.
    *   This class will take the `ttLib.TTFont` object, `options`, and `filterByFeatures` (for suffix generation) as arguments.
    *   Update `RemapByOTL` to instantiate and use `FontNamer`.

5.  **Create `src/opentype_feature_freezer/reporting.py`:**
    *   Move `_reportFont` method into a new class, e.g., `Reporter`.
    *   This class will take `reportLangSys` and `reportFeature` as arguments.
    *   Update `RemapByOTL` to instantiate and use `Reporter`.

6.  **Update `src/opentype_feature_freezer/__init__.py`:**
    *   The `RemapByOTL` class will become a coordinator. Its `__init__` will initialize instances of the new classes.
    *   The `run` method will orchestrate the calls to methods in these new instances.
    *   Ensure proper passing of `ttLib.TTFont` object and `options` (or specific attributes from `options`) to the new classes.
    *   Adjust imports to reflect the new module structure.

7.  **Refactor `RemapByOTL.run()`:**
    *   The `run` method should be simplified to a sequence of calls to the new, specialized objects.
    *   Consider using a `try...finally` block for `closeFont` to ensure the font is always closed.

8.  **Update `src/opentype_feature_freezer/cli.py` and `app/OTFeatureFreezer.py`:**
    *   Adjust imports if `RemapByOTL`'s location or name changes, or if any other directly imported components are moved.
    *   Ensure the `options` object (Namespace) passed to `RemapByOTL` remains compatible with its new `__init__` signature.

9.  **Update Tests:**
    *   Modify existing tests in `tests/test_freeze.py` and `tests/test_rename.py` to reflect the new class structure. This will likely involve mocking or directly instantiating the new, smaller classes for unit testing, and ensuring integration tests still work with the refactored `RemapByOTL`.

## 2. Refactoring `tests/test_rename.py`

This test file can be split based on the type of font being tested (TTF vs. OTF) to improve organization and readability.

**Current State:**
`tests/test_rename.py` contains tests for both TTF and OTF font renaming.

**Proposed Structure:**

```
tests/
├── test_freeze.py
├── test_rename_ttf.py  # New file for TTF renaming tests
├── test_rename_otf.py  # New file for OTF renaming tests
└── conftest.py
```

**Detailed Plan:**

1.  **Create `tests/test_rename_ttf.py`:**
    *   Move `test_rename_ttf`, `test_rename_ttf_no_replace`, `test_rename_ttf_autosuffix`, and `test_rename_ttf_with_nameid16` from `tests/test_rename.py` to `tests/test_rename_ttf.py`.
    *   Ensure all necessary imports (`fontTools.ttLib`, `opentype_feature_freezer`, `Namespace`, `shared_datadir`) are present in the new file.

2.  **Create `tests/test_rename_otf.py`:**
    *   Move `test_rename_otf` and `test_rename_otf_with_nameid16` from `tests/test_rename.py` to `tests/test_rename_otf.py`.
    *   Ensure all necessary imports are present in the new file.

3.  **Delete `tests/test_rename.py`:**
    *   Once all tests are moved, delete the original `tests/test_rename.py` file.

## 3. Refactoring `app/dmgbuild_settings.py`

This file contains utility functions that are not directly related to DMG build settings and can be extracted into a more general utility module.

**Current State:**
`app/dmgbuild_settings.py` contains `get_version` and `icon_from_app` functions.

**Proposed Structure:**

```
app/
├── dmgbuild_settings.py    # Main settings file
├── utils.py                # General utility functions (e.g., get_version)
├── mac_app_utils.py        # macOS-specific utility functions (e.g., icon_from_app)
└── ...
```

**Detailed Plan:**

1.  **Create `app/utils.py`:**
    *   Move the `get_version` function from `app/dmgbuild_settings.py` to `app/utils.py`.
    *   Update the import path for `__init__.py` within `get_version` if necessary (it currently uses `../src/opentype_feature_freezer/__init__.py`, which might need adjustment if `utils.py` is moved to a different level).

2.  **Create `app/mac_app_utils.py`:**
    *   Move the `icon_from_app` function from `app/dmgbuild_settings.py` to `app/mac_app_utils.py`.
    *   Ensure `biplist` is imported in `mac_app_utils.py`.

3.  **Update `app/dmgbuild_settings.py`:**
    *   Import `get_version` from `app.utils`.
    *   Import `icon_from_app` from `app.mac_app_utils`.
    *   Remove the original definitions of these functions.

4.  **Update `app/macdeploy`:**
    *   If `get_version` is used directly in `macdeploy` (which it is), ensure the `perl` command still correctly locates `__init__.py` or update it to call the new `get_version` function from `app.utils`. For simplicity, it might be best to leave the `perl` command as is, as it's a shell script and not Python.

**General Considerations for all Refactorings:**

*   **Imports:** Pay close attention to import statements. When moving code, ensure that all necessary modules are correctly imported in their new locations and that old references are updated.
*   **Relative vs. Absolute Imports:** Prefer absolute imports (e.g., `from opentype_feature_freezer.font_io import FontIOHandler`) within the package to avoid issues with how Python resolves relative imports.
*   **Type Hinting:** Maintain and update existing type hints, and add new ones where appropriate, especially for new function signatures or class attributes.
*   **Testing:** After each refactoring step, run the relevant tests (and ideally all tests) to ensure no regressions have been introduced.
*   **Version Control:** Perform these changes in small, atomic commits. Each commit should ideally represent a single logical refactoring step.
*   **Docstrings and Comments:** Update docstrings and comments to reflect the new structure and responsibilities of classes and functions.
*   **`pyproject.toml` and `mypy.ini`:** Ensure that the `source` paths in `pyproject.toml` for coverage and `mypy` configuration in `mypy.ini` are updated to include the new files/directories.
*   **`PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`:** Update these files to reflect the completed refactoring tasks and any new tasks that arise from the refactoring.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
